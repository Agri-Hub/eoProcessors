# Earth Observation Data Processors

The Earth Observation Data Processors repository is a curated collection of autonomous processors designed for advanced analysis of satellite data within Earth Observation (EO) projects. Each processor, developed in Python and encapsulated within its own Docker environment, leverages a rich ecosystem of libraries such as GDAL, rasterio, Open Data Cube, numba, xarray, pandas, and polars. This project aims to simplify and enhance the searching, downloading, pre and post processing of EO data for researchers and developers alike.

Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/Agri-Hub/eoProcessors/wiki) Github section for further information, installation and usage of each individual processor.
